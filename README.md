Hi, I'm Andrew Photinakis, I'm a rising sophomore at Rochester Institute of Technology majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Finance. My techincal interests surround financial technology, software engineering, cloud computing, and data science. 

Despite it being summer, I am currently taking the time to learn new languages, skills, and concepts. At the moment, I am learning more about BackEnd development, including databases, operating systems, and APIs. Also, I am currently looking for a co-op/internship for the Summer 2023. I plan on taking a lot of time this summer to expand my knowledge to put me in the best possible position the following summer not only for myself but also for the company I will work for. 

If you would like to collaborate on a project or talk about other opportunities, my LinkedIn will be below. Feel free to shoot my a message, I'd love to connect.
